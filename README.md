# Weather App

This project was made using React JS and Tailwind CSS using the OpenWeatherMap API.

This web app is hosted on [Netlify](https://weather-app-with-reac7.netlify.app/).

Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times, hourly and daily forecasts are fetched from the OpenWeather endpoints.
You can also view the current date and time for any location and change the temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Enter names of places into the search bar or use the geolocation feature to find the temperature in a city near you.  
There are also some quick links to some cities at the top.
